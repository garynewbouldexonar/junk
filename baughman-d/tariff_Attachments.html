  <p ALIGN="CENTER">Methodology To Assess Available Transmission Capability</p>
  </b><p>Cinergy will respond to a firm point-to-point transmission service request by
  performing studies to determine if sufficient transmission capacity is available to
  accommodate the request. These studies will consist of an evaluation of the thermal
  interconnection capability, the calculation of system transfer capability, and an analysis
  of the configuration of the interconnected system. The transfer capacity available will be
  the remaining capacity after accounting for the Transmission Provider's reliability
  requirements to serve its Native Load Customers, the rights of joint owners of the
  Transmission System under joint transmission ownership agreements, and prior contractual
  commitments including any integration service contract(s) previously filed. The study will
  analyze the impact of the proposed transmission request on the thermal capability and
  voltage profile of the transmission system, considering the reliability requirements and
  commitments discussed.</p>
  <p>Cinergy will adhere to Good Utility Practice, NERC Guidelines, and ECAR procedures and
  criteria when conducting the studies. In addition, Cinergy will have its own criteria,
  which will be designed to minimize customer outages and prevent equipment damage during
  probable contingencies. The transfer capabilities will be computed based on applicable
  NERC Guides. </p>
  <p>The Transmission Provider will also adhere to the ECAR procedures that guide the
  calculation of transfer capacities that may be found in the most recent ECAR Assessment of
  Transmission System Performance.</p>
  <p>The system performance will be evaluated by the Transmission Provider utilizing ECAR
  power flow models. These models are developed by ECAR member systems and include firm
  transfers in the base case. The transfer capacity computed will be incremental to the base
  case values. Normally, Cinergy will utilize ECAR models that have been modified to provide
  a more detailed representation of the Cinergy system. The Transmission Provider will make
  these modified cases available upon request. </p>
  <p>ECAR prepares load flow models that represent system conditions up to 10 years in the
  future. The actual series of models developed during any particular year are determined by
  mutual agreement. Cinergy will select the power flow models that most closely align with
  the commencement date and the period of the requested Transmission Service to analyze the
  impact of the proposed transmission usage.</p>
  <p>The Transmission Provider will use commercially available power system analysis
  software packages to conduct the studies. The Transmission Provider will use at a minimum,
  the line outage lists used by ECAR for operating studies for the upcoming seasonal peaks.
  Transfer capabilities calculated utilizing a linear load flow analysis package will be
  verified with AC analysis studies to determine if any voltage problems occur or lines
  overload due to reactive power flows. The transfer capability studies may also be
  supplemented with dynamic studies if the system appears to be approaching a stability
  constraint. </p>
  <p>The Transmission Provider will compute the First Contingency Incremental Transfer
  Capability (FCITC) from the delivering party to the receiving party. This will be used to
  determine the maximum amount of power that may be transferred (incremental to the transfer
  modeled in the base case) with the most critical transmission line out of service and
  transmission line loadings and voltages within their respective emergency ratings prior to
  operator directed system adjustments. If operating procedures exist that will increase the
  transfer capability, the transfer capability will be computed assuming that the procedure
  is in effect. However, if the constraint or the operating procedure is in another control
  area, the purchaser of the transmission service and the Transmission Provider will need to
  contact the other control area to determine the general availability of the procedure and
  to help evaluate the constraint.</p>
  <p>The methodology used to calculate the transfer capability calculation will depend on
  the service requested. The methodology utilized is: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A. <u>Purchase from a specified unit(s)</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  </u><p>For this case the FCITC will be determined by </p>
  <p>increasing the power from the specific unit designated by the purchaser as its power
  supply and either 1) increasing the receiving area load or 2) decreasing the receiving
  area generation. The selection of 1) or 2) will depend on the transaction being evaluated.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>B. <u>Purchase from a Control Area</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  </u><p>In this case the FCITC will be calculated by increasing generation based on the
  projected operation of the systems when considering the transfer and either increasing
  receiving area load or decreasing receiving area generation.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>C. <u>Sales</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  </u><p>FCITC modeling power sales will be calculated similarly to the purchases above.</p>
  <p>If the studies determine that a constraint occurs in another control area not
  participating in the transaction, the Transmission Provider and the purchaser of the
  transmission service will need to work with the appropriate parties to determine if the
  limitation is valid and what facility additions may be required to support the transfer.
  The purchaser has the option to reduce the request to a level that alleviates the
  constraint.</p>
  <p>Studies will be conducted utilizing several different base cases. The first case will
  be the normal base case which is the ECAR base case with appropriate detail added. The
  second case will be a reliability import base case, in which different base load
  generators are reduced to zero MW and imports are scheduled into the Cinergy Control Area
  to make up for the outage generation. The outage generation will be replaced by modeling
  imports from surrounding control areas based on their ability to supply the power. The
  FCITC values calculated from the reliability import case allow for the outage of various
  generating resources. </p>
  <p>The transfer capacity that will be considered to be available is the lowest of: (1) the
  lowest value from the FCITC calculation, (2) the reliability import case, (3) the thermal
  limits of the facilities that form the interface between Cinergy and either party, less
  any amount for existing transactions. In any case, the outage of direct interconnects will
  result in the loss of the ability to transfer power.</p>
  <p>The Transmission Provider may also perform simulations for off-peak conditions if study
  is required to determine limitations.</p>
  <p>Cinergy will perform all studies related to Transmission Service requests as it
  performs transmission studies for its own use of the system. However, as a practical
  matter, it must be noted that planning studies must gauge the performance of the system
  based on a limited number of simulations. In actual daily operation of the system the
  limits as determined in the transfer capability study may vary due to system conditions.</p>

    <b><p>ARTICLE III</p>
    <p><u>METERING AND DATA ACQUISITION</p>
    </u><p>3.1 Metering</b> - The electric power received from resources and delivered under
    the Tariff and this Service Agreement shall be determined from measurements taken at, or
    adjusted to measurements taken at such resources and the Customer's Network Load, or from
    a schedule of delivered quantities. Suitable metering equipment shall include standard
    types of electric meters, potential and current transformers, and such other appurtenances
    as shall be necessary to give the instantaneous values of kilowatts and kilovars, and an
    automatic record of kilowatt-hours for each clock hour. When there is a possibility of
    flows of electricity in either direction, then metering equipment shall be installed to
    provide metering data for each direction of flow. The specific types of metering
    equipment, the details of the metering arrangement and the records to be kept shall be
    determined by the Parties. The timing devices of all meters having such devices shall be
    maintained in time synchronism as closely as practicable. The meters shall be sealed and
    the seals shall be broken only upon occasions when the meters are to be tested or
    adjusted.</p>

    all routine or special tests and upon occasions when any readings, for purposes of
    settlements, are taken from meters not bearing an automatic record.</p>
    <p>If any test of metering equipment shall disclose any inaccuracy exceeding two percent
    (2%), the accounts between the Parties for service theretofore delivered pursuant to this
    Service Agreement shall be adjusted to correct for the inaccuracy disclosed over the
    shorter of the following two periods: (1) for the thirty (30)-day period immediately
    preceding the day of the test; or (2) for the period that such inaccuracy may be
    determined to have existed. Should the metering equipment as provided hereunder at any
    time fail to register, the electric power and energy delivered shall be determined from
    the best available data.</p>
    <p>For the purpose of checking the records of the metering equipment installed by one of
    the Parties as hereinabove provided, the other Party shall have the right to install check
    metering equipment at the metering points. Metering equipment so installed by one Party on
    the premises of the other Party, unless otherwise provided for in this Service Agreement,
    shall be owned and maintained by the Party installing such equipment. Upon termination of
    this Service Agreement, the Party owning such metering equipment shall remove it from the
    premises of the other Party. Authorized representatives of both Parties shall have access

    <p><u>RECORDS AND SUPPLY OF DATA</p>
    </u><p>4.1 Records</b> - The Parties shall keep, by mutual agreement, confirmation letters
    and other records as may be needed by the Parties for the purposes of this Service
    Agreement. The confirmation letters and other records shall be open to inspection at all
    reasonable times by representatives of each Party. The confirmation letters and records
    shall be retained by the respective Parties for a minimum of five (5) years from the date
    of such record, or such longer period as is required by any regulatory agency having
    jurisdiction in the matter or by any regulatory agency having jurisdiction over the
    Parties.</p>
    <b><p>4.2 Supply of Data</b> - Each Party shall furnish to the other Party data available
    to it on such time bases as are established by the Parties when such data are needed for
    settlement, operating records, or other purposes consistent with the objectives thereof.
    As promptly as reasonably practicable, each Party shall render to the other Party
    statements setting forth data from sources available to it in such detail and with such

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Calculation of Out-of-Pocket Costs for Emission Allowances</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following procedures will be applied to determine the Out-of-Pocket Costs for
emission allowances for services provided to Transmission Customers under this Tariff.
Emission allowance costs will be charged to Transmission Customers only if the Company is
authorized to do so pursuant to a Service Schedule on file with the Commission. These
procedures are based on the procedures filed by the Company in Docket No. ER95-501, for
the recovery of emission allowance costs pursuant to coordination agreements, or as
specifically set out in coordination agreements filed with the Commission. If in a final
order in Docket No. ER95-501 the Commission requires the Company to revise its procedures
for calculating the costs charged to Transmission Customers for emission allowances, the
Company will file an amendment to this Attachment L incorporating the appropriate changes
required in that docket.</p>

<p>(1) If a Transmission Customer receives a service from the Company pursuant to this
Tariff and the rate for the service permits the Company to recover its Out-of-Pocket Costs
associated with providing the service, the Transmission Customer shall have the option of
(a) compensating the Company for the Company's cost of emission allowances associated with
providing the service, as determined according to the procedures set forth herein, or (b)
supplying to the Company the allowances required by the Company to provide the service.
Prior to the start of the transaction, the Transmission Customer shall notify the Company
of its election to purchase or supply emission allowances. The running total of emission
allowances to be charged or supplied will be shown on the monthly invoices to the
purchasing Party.</p>

<p>(2) By January 15th of the year following the calendar year in which the transaction
occurred, the Transmission Customer shall transfer the appropriate emission allowances to
the Company for the emission allowances used when the allowances are provided in kind or
shall reimburse the Company for the cost of the emission allowances.</p>

<p>(3) For each hour in which there is a transaction for energy services using an
Out-of-Pocket Cost rate under this Tariff, the Company will:</p>

                  unit and the corresponding incremental SO<sub>2</sub> emission levels, as determined by
                  the computer based tools, for the identified units dispatched to serve the transaction;

                  number of tons of SO<sub>2</sub> produced per million BTU (<u>i.e.</u>, British Thermal
                  Unit) of fuel burned by each such unit for the transaction; and (iv) letting one (1)

<p>When a Security Coordinator identifies or is informed that transmission facilities
within his Security Area are about to exceed, or have exceeded, their Operating Security
Limit, the Security Coordinator shall, at his discretion, use either: 

<ul>
  <li>A &quot;local&quot; transmission loading relief procedure if that procedure includes the
    transmission system with the Constraint, or</li>
  <li>The NERC Transmission Loading Relief Procedure as detailed in this Appendix.</li>
</ul>

<p>The NERC Transmission Loading Relief Procedure provides Security Coordinators with an
orderly process to maintain or return transmission equipment loading to within Operating
Security Limits. The Procedure includes nine Levels:</p>

<p>Level 1 &#150; Notify Security Coordinators of potential Operating Security Limit
violations</p>

<p>Level 2a &#150; Hold additional INTERCHANGE TRANSACTIONs to prevent Operating Security
Limit violations</p>

<p>Level 2b &#150; Reallocate Firm Transmission Service</p>

<p>Level 2c &#150; Reallocate Non-firm Transmission Service</p>

<p>Level 3 &#150; Curtail INTERCHANGE TRANSACTIONs served by Non-firm Transmission Service
Arrangements</p>

<p>Level 4 &#150; Reconfigure and Redispatch</p>

<p>If an Operating Security Limit violation is imminent, Security Coordinators may direct
their Control Areas to neither change nor confirm additional INTERCHANGE TRANSACTIONs, as
identified by the Security Coordinators, in a manner that will aggravate the condition
(for example, changing the transmission contract path but not the actual source and sink).

<p>Should curtailment become necessary, <i>all</i> INTERCHANGE TRANSACTIONs, including

<p>The NERC Transmission Loading Relief Procedure is a nine-level process for managing
INTERCHANGE TRANSACTIONs and mitigating Operating Security Limit violations. Security
Coordinators must keep the Transmission Providers informed when entering and leaving these
TLR levels.</p>

<p>The Security Coordinators may not necessarily follow these TLR Levels in their
numerical order. Furthermore, if a Security Coordinator deems that a transmission loading

authority to immediately direct the Control Areas to redispatch generation or reduce load
to mitigate the critical condition until INTERCHANGE TRANSACTIONs can be reduced utilizing
the TLR Procedures, or other methods, to return the system to a secure state.</p>

<p>The TLR Procedure is guided by information obtained from the interim Interchange
Distribution Calculator (iIDC). Security Coordinators must also treat known INTERCHANGE
TRANSACTIONs that may not appear in the iIDC in accordance with the procedures in this
document.</p>

<p>Reserving transmission service for an INTERCHANGE TRANSACTION along a &quot;contract
path&quot; may not reflect the actual distribution of the power flows over the
transmission network from generation source to load sink. INTERCHANGE TRANSACTIONs
arranged over a contract path may, therefore, overload transmission elements on other
electrically parallel paths. The Security Coordinators must agree on how the NERC
Transmission Loading Relief Procedure will handle these INTERCHANGE TRANSACTIONs to,
first, ensure the operational security of the Interconnection and, second, respect the
obligations of the Transmission Provider. It is also important to agree on the obligations
of the Transmission Providers on and off the contract path regarding reconfiguring their
transmission systems and redispatching their generation to mitigate an overload on their
own system, and others&#146;.</p>

  <li>A Transmission Provider providing non-firm Transmission Service is <i>not</i> obligated
    to arrange for generation redispatch or transmission reconfiguration to mitigate
    constraints on its transmission system. The transaction is considered non-firm, even if
    other links in the contract path are firm, and takes on the lowest transmission service
    priority along the contract path.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Discussion.</b> The Transmission Provider simply has to call its Security Coordinator
    for TLR and allow the curtailments to progress until the relief is realized. Firm
    Transmission Service links elsewhere in the contract path do not obligate Transmission
    Providers providing non-firm service to treat the transaction as firm. For curtailment
    purposes, the INTERCHANGE TRANSACTION&#146;s priority will be the lowest priority
    Transmission Service on its contract path unless the constraint was on a link for which
    Firm Transmission Service was arranged. (See Principle #2 below.)<br>
  </li>
  <li VALUE="3">A Transmission Provider providing Firm Transmission Service <i>is</i>
    obligated to redispatch its generation or reconfigure its transmission system to mitigate
    constraints on its transmission system before curtailing firm INTERCHANGE TRANSACTIONs
    that are called for under the TLR. This obligation exists regardless of whether the other
    links in the contract path are firm or non-firm. Furthermore, for curtailment purposes an
    INTERCHANGE TRANSACTION will be considered Firm if the constraint is on a link for which
    Firm Transmission Service was arranged.<br>
    <b>Discussion.</b> The Transmission Provider providing Firm Transmission Service is
    obligated to transfer the energy from its point of receipt to its point of delivery
    regardless of the arrangements the Transmission Customer has made with other Transmission
    Providers along the contract path. However, other Transmission Providers along the firm
    path may redispatch or reconfigure at the request of the Transmission Provider providing
    Firm Transmission Service with the constraint if agreements are in place to do so.</li>

    <font FACE="Century Schoolbook" COLOR="#0000ff"><b><p>For Constraints off the Contract
    Path</p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ol START="3">
  </b></font>
  <li>A Transmission Provider providing Non-Firm Transmission Service is <i>not</i> obligated
    to redispatch generation or reconfigure transmission to mitigate Constraints on any
    transmission system off the contract path unless there are agreements in place to curtail
    or redispatch on-system INTERCHANGE TRANSACTIONs.<br>
  </li>
</ol>

<dir>
  <dir>
    <b><p>Discussion</b>. An INTERCHANGE TRANSACTION arranged over a contract path where one
    or more individual links consist of Non-firm Transmission Service is considered a non-firm
    INTERCHANGE TRANSACTION for Constraints off the contract path. All such INTERCHANGE
    TRANSACTIONs with a 5% or greater PTDF over the Constraints will be curtailed to relieve a
    Constraint off the contract path before any firm INTERCHANGE TRANSACTIONs are curtailed.
    The priority level for curtailment purposes will be the <i>lowest</i> level of
    transmission service arranged for on the contract path.<br>
    <br>
    Firm links in a transmission contract path do not make the entire path firm, they only
    ensure that the Transmission Providers providing those firm links will treat the
    INTERCHANGE TRANSACTION as firm with respect to their own system. The link with the lowest
    level priority defines the priority for the INTERCHANGE TRANSACTION.<br>
    </p>
  </dir>
</dir>

<ol START="4">
  <li>A INTERCHANGE TRANSACTION arranged over a contract path where all the individual links
    are provided as Firm Transmission Service is considered a firm INTERCHANGE TRANSACTION and
    will <i>not</i> be curtailed to relieve a Constraint off the contract path until all
    non-firm INTERCHANGE TRANSACTIONs with a 5% or greater PTDF over the Constraints have been
    curtailed. The Security Coordinator will determine which Control Areas will arrange for
    redispatch or reconfiguration to mitigate the Constraint.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Discussion.</b> If the entire contract path is Firm, then the TLR procedure will treat
    the INTERCHANGE TRANSACTION as firm even for Constraints off the contract path and will
    not curtail that INTERCHANGE TRANSACTION until all non-firm INTERCHANGE TRANSACTIONs have
    been curtailed. However, Transmission Providers off the contract path are not obligated to
    reconfigure or redispatch their systems unless special arrangements are in place. Because
    the INTERCHANGE TRANSACTION is considered firm &quot;everywhere,&quot; the Security
    Coordinator may attempt to arrange for Transmission Providers or Control Areas to
    redispatch generation or reconfigure transmission, even if they are off the contract path,
    to try to avoid curtailing the INTERCHANGE TRANSACTION that is using Firm Transmission
    Service. If agreements are in place to provide for redispatch to relieve the Constraint,
    these agreements should be evaluated by the Security Coordinator before asking others to
    redispatch.<br>
