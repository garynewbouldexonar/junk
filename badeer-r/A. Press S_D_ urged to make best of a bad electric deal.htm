            <P><B>July 8, 2000</B> 
            <P><!--- BODYTEXT ---><BR>The proponents of electrical deregulation 
            in California -- who promised that open markets would bring an array 
            of consumer choices and lower prices -- are now encouraging San 
            Diego to contract for years with a single power provider at prices 
            likely far higher than they were as recently as May.
            <P>The calls to lock in prices with a major power company come as 
            politicians, consumer advocates and SDG&amp;E scramble for ways to 
            bring stability to the local power market, where electricity costs 
            have tripled in recent weeks and show no sign of leveling off.
            <P>A long-term contract with a single provider at a fixed price is 
            being touted as a "market" solution to San Diego's power problem.
            <P>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., which passes along the price it 
            pays for power to consumers in San Diego County, says it is in 
            discussion with several companies. The local utility declined to 
            discuss details, but state Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, said one 
            offer has come from Enron Corp., a representative of which was among 
            the leaders of a coalition that defeated tighter state power price 
            controls earlier this week.
            <P>Houston-based Enron, the nation's biggest power marketer, is 
            offering to sell San Diego power for four years at 5.5 cents per 
            kilowatt hour, according to Peace. The price would be about 50 
            percent less than current costs, but more than 50 percent above 
            rates paid as recently as this spring.
            <P>Under California's deregulation plan, San Diegans became the 
            first in the state to pay market prices for power. Other major urban 
            areas will continue to pay regulated rates for at least one year.
            <P>But San Diego has paid a steep price for its precedent: Typical 
            power bills have risen from about $55 last year at this time to $90, 
            with higher costs expected as the summer heats up. Peace, the key 
            architect of California's deregulation, said the Enron offer was 
            encouraging.
            <P>"The good news is that there is an offer on the table that would 
            contain the bleeding," Peace said. But he quickly added that Enron's 
            offer would be the first among many from other power companies.
            <P>"We can find out in a few days if the market can respond," Peace 
            said. "If they don't, the (California Public Utilities Commission) 
            must put a rate freeze into effect."
            <P>Peace said attempts to bring a competitive electricity market to 
            California have been stymied by power companies, who are exploiting 
            the embryonic market for their own advantage.
            <P>"These guys are hiding behind the mantra of competition to 
            profiteer. There is no doubt about it," he said.
            <P>If the "profiteering" can't be stopped, it "will lead to 
            re-regulation of the power industry in California and the rest of 
            the nation," Peace said.
            <P>SDG&amp;E would need approval from the Public Utilities 
            Commission to enter into a long-term, fixed-price power contract. 
            The PUC rejected such a request last year, but that was before the 
            big run-up in power prices.
            <P>Long-term contracts represent a gamble on future prices: if 
            market prices rise about the fixed price, the bet is won. If prices 
            fell below the contract, the bet would in effect cost the region 
            money.
            <P>It's a wager that industry analysts say Enron may be better 
            positioned to make than San Diego.
            <P>"What would happen is that you would pay a lower rate than the 
            free market in summer but a higher rate in the winter," said Michael 
            Heim, a power industry analyst who follows Enron for A.G. Edwards.
            <P>"Enron is pretty smart. They don't put out those bets unless they 
            believe it will be good for them and bad for the customers."
            <P>Added David Fleischer, a managing director of research at Goldman 
            Sachs: "Enron takes less risk than anyone I know."
            <P>A prominent state consumer advocate also criticized the prospect 
            of a long-term power deal at this time.
            <P>"This is no better than a boiler fraud on the people," said 
            Harvey Rosenfield, who unsuccessfully pressed a ballot initiative to 
            overturn deregulation. "They jack up rates over 200 percent -- then 
            they offer you a deal at a 50 percent hike.
            <P>"I don't think the solution to this problem is to put the people 
            of San Diego at the mercy of Enron."
            <P>SDG&amp;E, meanwhile, said it will hold a emergency meeting of 
            energy market players in San Diego on Wednesday to explore methods 
            of reining in high power prices.
            <P>"Clearly, there are problems in the marketplace that need to be 
            addressed -- and addressed now," said Edwin Guiles, president of 
            SDG&amp;E.
            <P>The San Diego utility company also said it will seed a new fund 
            to assist low-income customers with their power bills. SDG&amp;E 
            said it will provide $1 in corporate funding for every $4 other 
            companies contribute, with a minimum $100,000 commitment from 
            SDG&amp;E.
            <P>The fund would supplement other programs, along with the 
            utility's level-payment plan, which allows customers to average 
            power costs over a yearly cycle.
            <P>Mayor Susan Golding yesterday scheduled a July 20 public hearing 
            on electricity prices. The hearing is set for 6 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. in 
            Kearny Mesa at the Ridgehaven Court Environmental Services Building, 
            9601 Ridgehaven Court.
            <P>"The mayor's main concern is to find out the reasons why the 
            public is paying an exorbitant cost of more money in their 
            electricity bills," said Ric Grenell, Golding's press secretary.
            <P>"It's inexcusable that they've spiked over the last couple of 
            months," he said.
            <P>Among those who have agreed to participate in the hearing are 
            California Energy Commission Chairman William Keese, Commissioner 
            Art Rosenfeld and representatives of SDG&amp;E, the Regional Energy 
            Office and the U.S. Department of Energy, Grenell said.
            <P>At the state level, Peace said that by the end of the month he 
            will submit a proposal to provide Gov. Gray Davis with emergency 
            powers to build power plants and transmission line in the state. 
            Peace said the emergency authority is needed to expedite the 
            projects and address the state's power shortfall.
            <P>"The governor indicated to me he'd like to have a proposal before 
            July 24th," Peace said, insisting the emergency powers would help 
            protect the environment by coordinating project development.
            <P>But consumer advocates said such emergency powers could override 
            environmental protection and local review of power plant siting.
            <P>"Now that we're at the mercy of the greed of the utility 
            industry, their response is that we need to strip away the rest of 
            consumer and environmental protections," Rosenfield said.
            <P>"We must cram this genie back into the bottle. We have to get 
            back to regulating this industry."
