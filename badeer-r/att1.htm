<br>THE FRIDAY BURRITO
<br>"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."
<p>Everyone is getting into the act.&nbsp; When I started this gig, I was
the only guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry
in California.&nbsp; I wrote about what’s new, what’s happening, and all
the important stuff.&nbsp; This week, Governor Gray Davis decided to write
his own Burrito.&nbsp; His epistle got more press than mine, but why is
he muscling in on my turf?&nbsp; Not to be outdone, PUC President Loretta
Lynch released a report which looks into every facet of California’s power
business.&nbsp; No stone left unturned. I’m telling you, there isn’t enough
room in this business for all of us.&nbsp; They need to clear out.
<p>With people like Herr (Hair?) Peace, Governor I’m-Not Mr.-Rogers Davis
and Let’s Do Lynch, who needs a Friday Burrito?&nbsp; They re-define our
reality each week with mind-numbing aplomb.&nbsp; For example, starting
in early June, the PX was ordered to compete for business against other
Qualified Trading Vehicles.&nbsp; Then, two weeks later, the Energy F&uuml;hrer
legislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for at
least one year.&nbsp; This week the PUC approved 5-year bilateral deals
for PG&amp;E and SCE, thereby opening the PX to competition, and emasculating
the PX’s Block Forward Market. Zip, bam, boom.
<p>I can’t wait to see what next week will bring.&nbsp; I hear Senator
Bowen is holding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry, and
the Governor’s new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things:
<p><font color="#5A47FF">What’s for lunch?</font>
<br><font color="#5A47FF">Who will sit at the head of the table?</font>
<br><font color="#5A47FF">Does anyone have good seats for next week’s Democratic
convention?</font>
<br><font color="#5A47FF">Is there anyone we haven’t indicted yet in the
power industry?</font>
<br><font color="#5A47FF">Who will crank up the air conditioning in this
room?&nbsp; It’s getting too warm.</font>
<p>Then, they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena,
ignore the facts, and publish a report.&nbsp; It makes one want to take
a deep breath, and inhale the scented fumes of democracy.
<p>You know, I can’t think about where to begin, so let’s start somewhere.
<p>>>> Things on the Island of California
<br>&nbsp;@@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&amp;E with a brain?
<br>&nbsp;@@@ The PUC issues its scathing report
<br>&nbsp;@@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps.&nbsp; Duh!
<p>>>> Things at the throne of FERC
<br>&nbsp;@@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order
<p>>>> Odds and Ends (_!_)
<p>>>> Things on the Island of California
<br>&nbsp;@@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&amp;E with a brain?
<p>Well, the answer very clearly is no.&nbsp; I have been astounded by
repeated attempts of SDG&amp;E’s most senior people to ape humans, but
instead they mimic apes.
<p>Consider the following.&nbsp; First, they waltz their default customers
into the summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the wholesale
market.&nbsp; Forgivable in that it is human to err.&nbsp; The prices skyrocket
in June, and they start looking for who to blame.&nbsp; “Must be them damn
independent generators,” say their managers.&nbsp; Gary Cotton informs
the ISO Governing Board that hedging SDG&amp;E’s position in the Block
Forward Market wouldn’t have made any difference.&nbsp; There’s one nobel
laureate who missed his prime.
<p>Next, under pressure, they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else
who will assist the utility and their customers.&nbsp; Nine offers show
up at their table, and they can’t choose any of them.&nbsp; Again, Mr Cotton
tells his fellow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time,
and we don’t to rush since there are many legislative barriers, and, well,
the surfing was good this week so why spoil it?
<p>Now they are in a panic because the Energy F&uuml;hrer is visiting old
ladies living in trailer parks, advising them not to pay their SDG&amp;E
electricity bill, and to continue to operate their air conditioners.&nbsp;
SDG&amp;E puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that
SDG&amp;E is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills, including
asking the ISO for a $250 price cap, but the public can help by calling
the ISO [address and phone number provided in the ad] and urging them to
lower the cap.&nbsp; I always thought the location of the ISO was a State
secret for security reasons.&nbsp; No secrets in San Diego.
<p>But we are not done.&nbsp; No sir, we are not.&nbsp; Those buffalo heads
who run that company decide they will win a gold star on their collective
foreheads, and implement one of the four resolutions passed by the Electric
Oversight Board.&nbsp; The one they pick is to petition FERC on an expedited
basis to cap at $250, the price at which sellers may bid energy or ancillary
services into the ISO and the PX.&nbsp; The primary reason is that Western
power markets are not workably competitive.&nbsp; In other words, they
want FERC to set a max price on what generators can sell in addition to
the price limit at which the ISO can buy!
<p>What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDG&amp;E
continues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run
energy into the PX.&nbsp;&nbsp; These are sales from their stranded assets.&nbsp;
Their grief hasn’t abated their greed.
<p>So, to recap, SDG&amp;E missed the boat on price hedging, failed to
win consumer confidence in public meetings, asked for help from suppliers
and did nothing in response, then filed at FERC to cap the sale price because
the wholesale market into which they sell (over-priced?) energy is not
workably competitive.&nbsp; Too much time in the direct sun light.
<p>>>> Things on the Island of California
<br>&nbsp;@@@ The PUC issues its scathing report
<p>The PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent
enough time.&nbsp; I only read the Executive Summary, and that only because
our counsel, Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy. Let me pick out some of
the gems in President Lets Do Lynch’s burrito.&nbsp; I would recommend
reading the whole text if you have time, and if you seek perverse entertainment.
<p>“California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and
pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten years.
<p>“ Since June, wholesale prices for electrical power in California have
increased on average 270% over the same period in 1999, resulting in over
$1 billion in excess&nbsp;&nbsp; payments for electricity.
<p>“Hot weather, aging power plant and transmission infrastructure, and
dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined
to drive prices up ...
<p>“Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity,
purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in electricity
costs this year. Moreover, these price increases do not necessarily fund
new investments in electricity supply or delivery reliability - they may
flow solely to power producer profit margins.
<p>“Despite the Electricity Oversight Board's legislative mandate to oversee
those institutions, we have been unable to obtain [bid] data. Nevertheless,
... , we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior exists that the
Attorney General should conduct an investigation into these statewide market
practices, coordinating with other State agencies, including the PUC and
the EOB. Such an investigation would provide the factual foundation that
California policy makers and regulators need to recover any illegally obtained
profits.
<p>“A momentous consequence of California's attempt to create a market
in electricity is that the federal government now regulates California's
electric system. Washington D.C. now controls pricing decisions directly
at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and, to the extent
that supply incentives are correlated to prices, Washington, D.C. now affects
California's ability to attract new investment in power plants.
<p>“Past administrations' willingness to cede the State's authority to
the federal government combined with the legislative creation of two non-public
supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the public or consider
the retail customer. The "Independent System Operator" (ISO) and the "Power
Exchange" (PX), the nonprofit private corporations that operate the State's
transmission system and control wholesale pricing policies, are governed
by boards whose members can have serious conflicts of interest. Some of
these board members or their companies financially benefit from higher
prices in electricity markets. Neither of these private organizations is
accountable to the State or its consumers ....
<br>&nbsp;
<p>“Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the State's electric
services, the State of California should protect its businesses and consumers
from cartel pricing; collusive behavior; inadequate power plant maintenance
and lack of market planning for adequate electricity supplies.
<p>“California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance - as
San Diegans did not this summer - how and when the price of an essential
service like electricity will double. California is now largely constrained
by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail price relief as
long as wholesale prices remain so high. If California tried to re-impose
a price freeze in San Diego now, federal regulators would likely prevent
that action.&nbsp; ... Short-term price relief, however, cannot resolve
market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problems controlled by federal
regulators.
<p>&nbsp;“We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know
if the ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several fronts.
We do not know how market players acted in price offering and bidding and
scheduling. The FERC has just announced an inquiry into national pricing
and energy market issues. California should not wait for national findings
before it investigates California market practices. We recommend that the
California Attorney General immediately subpoena relevant records and data
to determine the pricing and offering behavior of market participants;
the actions of the ISO and its board members; and the actions of generators
in supplying California's energy needs.
<p>“Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current Electricity
Problems From Spreading in 2001: ...
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>2. Create a California Energy Council, modeled on the National
Security Council, to unify State action to resolve energy problems and
to perform integrated energy planning;
<p>3. Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to moderate California
wholesale market pricing;
<p>4. Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and western regional
markets and find that no competitive market exists in California power
markets;
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
...
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>&nbsp;8. Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISO/PX
stakeholder boards;
<p>9. Improve California's ability to obtain ISO and generator data and
enhance the State's enforcement capability for power plant maintenance;
price manipulation and generation gaming, consistent with protection of
proprietary business information;
<p>10. Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability and additional
oversight authority for the ISO and PX.</blockquote>

<p><br>“Ten Issues to Consider or Act Upon Within the Next Six Months:
...
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>4. Streamline state power plant siting procedures; consistent
with environmental requirements, and prioritize applications to advance
clean, BACT+ power plant proposals.
<p>5. Institute "use-it -or- lose-it" permitting power plant licensing
and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants get built;
<p>...
<p>&nbsp;8. Reform PX pricing protocols and structures to lower wholesale
and retail prices and reduce excess profits”</blockquote>

<p><br>I told you I don’t need to write a Burrito anymore.&nbsp; The Democrats
in Sacramento are doing that for me.&nbsp; Welcome comrade.
<p>>>> Things on the Island of California
<br>&nbsp;@@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps.&nbsp; Duh!
<p>It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Board meeting,
especially when our favorite topic arises.&nbsp; It seems the only time
the Board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the agenda:
price caps, FTRs, and priorities for software enhancements. Otherwise,
its pretty much hum-drum.
<p>‘Round and ‘round we went, once again.&nbsp; A few more forced votes
tipped the scale in favor of the cap.&nbsp; There were 15 yes votes, which
included a forced yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary
of Energy Mr. Richardson. [Jerry, did you realize that the last letters
of your name could be re-arranged to spell “NO ET YES”?&nbsp; Kind of a
french thing.] I’m sorry about that vote, Jerry.&nbsp; You still go in
my book as one of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidation
for so long.&nbsp; Your picture in the SF Chron said it all.
<p>The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet (Enron),
Jan Smutny-Jones (IEP), Barbara Barkovich (CLECA), Caolyn Kehrein (CMA),
Dan Kirshner (EDF), and Stacy Roscoe (Procter &amp; Gamble).&nbsp; Now,
I must admit that Dynegy’s Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No, spelled
“A-B-S-T-A-I-N”.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francis
in Houston to work with Greg to correct that problem.&nbsp; We’re going
to work things out.
<p>The Energy F&uuml;hrer addressed the Board, again.&nbsp; I didn’t mind
that I only had a few brief, very brief moments to address the Board, and
Herr (Hair?) Peace got over 20 minutes.&nbsp; That didn’t bother me at
all.&nbsp; He did more damage to himself in 20 than I could do in 2.&nbsp;
He blasted away at everyone who opposed him.&nbsp; He pined about Camden
quitting the Board.&nbsp; He said he knew how prices and markets work,
that it isn’t the way those academic egg-head, FERC-loving economists tell
you who pray to the gods of competition.&nbsp; He lambasted WAPA for withholding
generation to protect fish and wildlife (what was that all about?).&nbsp;
He predicted that on Thursday’s PUC meeting he and all the other powerful
Democrats, Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would demand that
the PUC impose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that are
just and reasonable (it didn’t happen).&nbsp; And on and on and on.&nbsp;
This man is very delusional. He believes that Steve, and only Steve Peace
can save the world.&nbsp; He believes that political will trumps judicial,
quasi-judicial, or independent Board actions.&nbsp; This man makes relevant
all the abstract musings of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900)
... The will to power, the &Ugrave;bermensch, the transvaluation of values,
etc.
<p>But we are getting under (uber?) his skin, with the help of the press.&nbsp;
Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if he thought
whether the next day’s PUC meeting was going to be a roll over. Dick said
he got a call from Peace, and that Peace said he would not come to the
meeting.&nbsp; Apparently, Peace had received a lot of press, and all of
it bad.
<p>That’s the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step
away from our front door.
<p>&nbsp;>>> Things at the throne of FERC
<br>&nbsp;@@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order
<p>And now, the good news.&nbsp; You deserve this.&nbsp; FERC gave the
California market a little wiggle room last Friday.&nbsp; FERC issued a
last minute reply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating
to the ISO’s intent to lower the price cap.&nbsp; FERC denied the complaint,
but they didn’t waste time with an Order to simply deny a complaint.&nbsp;
FERC danced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price
cap.
<p>Here are some excerpts:
<p>“We accepted this [Amendment 21], not because it was a cap on sellers’
prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the market
by clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing to
pay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether to
sell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere...
<p>“ ... The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy
than any other buyer of these services ... If the ISO is unable to elicit
sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price ceiling (because
generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose), it will have to
raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet its needs. ...
Therefore, an increase in out-of-market (OOM) calls for generation may
be necessary to maintain system reliability.&nbsp; Because the current
payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price, the resulting
overall payments may be higher.
<p>“To the extent the ... ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing
a directive that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets
under any circumstances (e.g., when system load exceeds 38,000 MW), such
a requirement is not permitted by our ... Order and the ISO tariff. ...
Future implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to a requirement
to sell would require significant revisions to the ISO market rules.&nbsp;
Such market changes could not become effective absent a corresponding amendment
to the ISO tariff which would have to be filed under section 205 of the
FPA.”
<p>Well. What do you think about that?
<p>Just wait.&nbsp; Here is what the sleeping bear, Commissioner Hebert
said in his concurring remarks:
<p>“Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begin
a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of the
California grid.&nbsp; The record supports such a move. ... A memorandum
to the ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board eloquently
brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the independence
of the ISO. The memorandum also thoughtfully outlines consequences to the
markets of a return to ‘command and control.’
<p>“Because these allegations come from a non-market participant, especially
should we take heed.&nbsp; We must also take notice of the public pressure
on the Board to compromise its independence.”
<p>Amen, brother, amen.
<p>>>> Odds and Ends (_!_)
<p>As you can imagine, this week, like an endless string of weeks before
this has been interminable.&nbsp; I get about three phone calls a day from
press reporters, very little of which ever sees print.&nbsp; My shtick
is just too complex for casual readers.&nbsp; But I do notice that the
reporters are asking better questions.&nbsp; The public is becoming more
savvy.&nbsp; The information flow is moving in our favor, and will disarm
the forces of evil, in about 10 years.
<p>I have other problems on my mind.&nbsp; I am working on a new computer
system.&nbsp; Really, it’s just an upgrade of an older computer that is
a bit faster than the laptop I tried to upgrade, very unsuccessfully.&nbsp;
As a result of the all the new hardware and software I purchased, my office
looks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies, computer documentation,
and diskettes laying all around. Quite a mess.
<p>Prepare for the future.&nbsp; Our next general meeting is scheduled
for Thursday and Friday, October 5 and 6 at Moro Bay.&nbsp; Barb Ennis
will prepare a blurb for us in next week’s Burrito about room reservations,
timing, golf, etc.&nbsp; Our guest speakers will include MSC Chairman Professor
Frank Wolak who will talk on the subject of his choice, Ms. Irene Moosen
of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make a presentation on the distributed
generation case before the PUC, and William Freddo of PG&amp;E National
Energy Group who will give us some education on operating a power plant
inside the New England ISO.
<p>Now for your daily bread, provided this week by Dan Douglass.&nbsp;
Last week we had a joke about Catholics.&nbsp; This week it’s agnostics.
<br>=====================
<br>An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods, admiring all that the
accident&nbsp; of evolution had created.&nbsp; "What majestic trees!&nbsp;
What powerful rivers! What&nbsp; beautiful animals!"&nbsp; he said to himself.
<p>As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes&nbsp;
behind him.&nbsp; As he turned to look, he saw a 7 foot grizzly bear charging&nbsp;
towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path.&nbsp; He looked over
his&nbsp; shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him.&nbsp; He
tried to run even&nbsp; faster, so scared that tears were coming to his
eyes. His heart was pumping&nbsp; frantically as he tried to run even faster,
but he tripped and fell on the&nbsp; ground.&nbsp; He rolled over to pick
himself up and saw the bear right on top of&nbsp; him raising its paw to
kill him.
<p>At that instant he cried out "Oh my God!" And time stopped. The bear
froze.&nbsp; The forest was silent.&nbsp; The river even stopped flowing.&nbsp;
A bright light shone&nbsp; upon the man, and a voice out of the sky said,
"You deny my existence all&nbsp; these years, teach others I don't exist
and even credit my creation to a&nbsp; cosmic accident, and now do you
expect me to help you out of this&nbsp; predicament?&nbsp; Am I to count
you as a believer?"
<p>The atheist, ever so proud, looked into the light and said, "It would
be rather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all these
years,&nbsp; but could you make the bear a believer?"
<p>"Very well" said the voice. And the light went out, the river flowed,
the&nbsp; sounds of the forest continued, and the bear brought both paws
together,&nbsp; bowed his head, and said, "Lord, I thank you for this food
which I am about&nbsp; to receive."
<br>==================
<p>Amen.&nbsp; And have a great weekend.&nbsp; Oh, and thanks to all of
you who sent me happy birthday wishes.&nbsp; It was very much appreciated.
